## [1.10.1] - May 25, 2022

### Changed

* Fixed a selection bug when running selective tests (e.g. by using `--groups`). The bug caused unrelated
  tests to run anyway.
* The `--continue-from` and `--skip-until` options can now be used with test identifiers enclosed in brackets
  (as they are displayed during a test run)


## [1.10.0] - Mar 03, 2022

### Added

* Add [tar_contains validator](/docs/validators/#tarcontainsvalidator) to validate contents of a tar file
* Add [zip_contains validator](/docs/validators/#zipcontainsvalidator) to validate contents of a zip file
* Add [tempfile plugin](/docs/plugins/#tempfileplugin) to create temporary files for a test
* Add `init` field for containers. Containers can use it to specify a custom initialization time (default=2)


## [1.9.0] - Dec 26, 2021

### Added

* Testers can now specify [external requirements](https://github.com/qtc-de/tricot/tree/develop/docs#external-requirements)
* Requirements are checked before the tester is run and can contain:
  * Required files (including checksums verification)
  * Required operating system commands
  * Required tricot version
   
### Changed

* Improved the selective test functionalities (`--skip-until`, `--continue-from`, `--ids`, `--groups`, `--exclude`, `--exclude-groups`).
  Skipped tests are now skipped completely and they neither appear in the output nor start their associated containers.
* Fix bug related to KeyboardInterrupts 
* Update test cases to make them more compatible among different distributions
