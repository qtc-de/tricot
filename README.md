### tricot

----

*tricot* is a *trivial command tester* that allows to test scripts, executables and commands for
expected behavior. Tests are configured within of *YAML* files and simply contain the command definitions
to execute along with a set of desired validators. This approach makes *tricot* a simple solution
for end to end testing of command line applications.

### Installation

----

*tricot* can be build and installed as a *pip package*. The following command installs *tricot*
for your current user profile:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/qtc-de/tricot
$ cd tricot
$ python3 setup.py sdist
$ pip3 install dist/*
```

*tricot* also supports autocompletion for *bash*. To take advantage of autocompletion, you need to have the
[completion-helpers](https://github.com/qtc-de/completion-helpers) project installed. If setup correctly, just
copying the [completion script](./resources/bash_completion.d/tricot) to your ``~/.bash_completion.d`` folder enables
autocompletion.

```console
$ cp resources/bash_completion.d/tricot ~/bash_completion.d/
```


### Usage

----

*tricot* tests are defined within of *YAML* files that can contain the following components:

* **Testers**: Each *tricot YAML* file is required to define exactly one *Tester*. The *Tester*
  basically describes the context of the current *YAML* file and sets attributes like it's *name*
  or *error_mode*. Furthermore, *tricot YAML* files can contain references to other *Testers*,
  which allows nesting *Testers*.

* **Tests**: *tricot YAML* files can contain an arbitrary number of *Tests*. Each *Test* contains
  the command you want to test and a set of validators that should be used to validate the commands
  output.

* **Validators**: As mentioned above, *Validators* are used within *Tests* to validate the result
  of a test command. *Validators* usually apply to the command output, but they can validate side
  effects as well. E.g. you can also use *Validators* to check whether a command created a specific
  file on the file system.

* **Plugins**: Plugins are mainly used to setup requirements for tests or to perform cleanup actions.
  They run before the actual *Tests* start and perform cleanup actions after the *Tests* finished.
  Plugins can e.g. be used to create files and directories required for the test, to run an operating
  system command before the test or to spawn a *HTTP listener* that is available during the test.

* **Containers**: When testing commands that interact with other systems, you probably want to run
  your tests against a docker container. *Container* definitions within of *tricot YAML* files can
  be used to start containers before your tests run. A container defined in a *YAML* file runs as
  long as the *Tests* from the corresponding *YAML* file are executed. After all tests have finished,
  the container is stopped.

* **Variables**: *tricot YAML* files can contain variable definitions. These can be used to prevent
  repetitions within of *Test* definitions. *Variables* are inherited when nesting *Testers*, which
  allows the definition of global variables within the toplevel *Tester*, that can be used by all
  sub *Testers*.

Sounds too complicated? Let's look at some examples!


### Examples

----

In this section we list some examples on how to use *tricot*. The tests performed in these examples
do not really make sense and are only used for demonstration purposes. If you are interested in some
real word examples, you should check the [Projects that use tricot](#projects-that-use-tricot) section.

**Example 1**:

* Test definition:
  ```yaml
  tester:
    name: ExampleTester
    title: Just an example test

  variables:
    passwd: /etc/passwd

  tests:
    - title: Test passwd File
      description: |-
        Test that our passwd file contains some expected user names.
        Make sure that david is not contained within our passwd file.

      command:
        - cat
        - ${passwd}
      validators:
        - status: 0
        - contains:
            ignore_case: False
            values:
              - root
              - bin
              - www-data
            invert:
              - david
  ```
* Output:
  ```console
  [qtc@kali Example]$ tricot -v example1.yml
  [+] Starting test: Just an example test
  [+]
  [+]         1. Test passwd File... success.
  ```

**Example 2**:

* Test definition:
  ```yaml

    name: ExampleTester
    title: Just an example test

  containers:
    - name: 'nginx'
      image: 'nginx:latest'
      aliases:
        DOCKER-nginx-IP: DOCKER-IP

  tests:
    - title: Test curl
      description: |-
